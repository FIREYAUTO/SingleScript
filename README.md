# SingleScript
A single-token interpreted language written in JavaScript
***
# Notes
This language uses a single-token tokenizer to parse code, so every token in the language is one character long. This means you can only create variables with one letter. It does have support for strings `"String"` and numbers `'Number'`. It also supports booleans, `T` (true) and `F` (false)

Object-Oriented programming is the best solution in this language if you want to use multi-character length names.

Documentation will be written soon.

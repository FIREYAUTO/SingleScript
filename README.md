# SingleScript
A single-token interpreted language written in JavaScript
***
# Notes
This language uses a single-token tokenizer to parse code, so every token in the language is one character long. This means you can only create variables with one letter--although using a new syntax feature <code>\`Text Here\`</code> allows you to force any text inside to become an Identifier. It does have support for strings `"String"` and numbers `'Number'`. It also supports booleans, `T` (true) and `F` (false)

Object-Oriented programming is the best solution in this language if you want to use multi-character length names.

More documentation will be written soon.

This language is extremely compressed in terms of code-design. It is not intended for usage in applications, and more of just a fun thing you can play around with. Although if you really want to go the length of using this language to provide some more challenges to overcome if users want to mess with your code, then you can use this language. I'm not stopping you though, go ahead and do anythng you'd like with it.
